## Xcode 12, building for iOS Simulator, but linking in an object file built for iOS, for architecture 'arm64'
Basically, you have to exclude **arm64** for the simulator architecture, both from your project and the Pod project.
* To do that, navigate to **Build Settings** of your project and add *Any iOS Simulator SDK* with value **arm64** inside *Excluded Architecture*.

You can manually add the **Excluded Architechure** in your Pod project's *Build Settings*, but it will be overwritten when you use `pod install`.
In place of this, you can add this snippet in your Podfile. It will write the neccessary **Build Settings** every time you run `pod install`.

```
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.build_configurations.each do |config|
    config.build_settings["EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]"] = "arm64"
  end
end
```

## Error Regarding undefined method map for nil:NilClass for Flutter App / CocoaPod Error
Happened to me during `pod update` or `pod install`.
```console
sudo arch -x86_64 gem install ffi
# go to ios folder then run
arch -x86_64 pod install
```

## Further podfile settings
```
config.build_settings['ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH'] = 'YES'
```
```
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
      flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
      target.build_configurations.each do |config|
        config.build_settings["EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]"] = "arm64"
        config.build_settings['ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH'] = 'YES'
         if config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'].to_f < 10.0
           config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '10.0'
         end
      end
  end
end
```

Refer to **Text Reognition** project for further detailed `podfile`.
